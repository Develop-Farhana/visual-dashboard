For instance, you could create a dashboard with multiple visualizations:

A line graph showing Intensity and Likelihood trends over Years.
A bar chart comparing the Relevance of different Topics.
A map showing the distribution of data by Country and City.
This approach allows viewers to grasp insights quickly from your data. Each visualization type should be chosen based on the nature of the data and the story you want to tell.
